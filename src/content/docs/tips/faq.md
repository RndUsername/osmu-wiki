<details>
<summary>My Bitaxe isn't hashing at the expected rate</summary>
<p>
  If you're experiencing reduced hash rates, try these troubleshooting steps:<br>
  First, physically disconnect and reconnect the power (don't just restart through the UI)<br>
  Check for overheating issues - ensure you're running firmware v2.3 or later to see temperature warnings<br>
  Verify your frequency and voltage settings in the UI under settings - reset to defaults if necessary<br>
  Confirm the input voltage is between 4.8-5.3v<br>
  If overclocking, you may need to increase voltage to match your frequency settings<br>
  As a last resort, try reflashing the firmware

<summary>What should I know about overclocking?</summary>
<p>
  Warning: Overclocking can permanently damage your device. If you choose to overclock:<br>
  Monitor dashboard values carefully, staying within recommended ranges listed below<br>
  Account for ambient temperature fluctuations by maintaining a safety margin<br>
  Ensure your power supply is adequate - voltage dropping below 4.8v indicates insufficient power. A higher-rated power supply may be necessary to support increased power demands<br>
  For best results, upgrade your heatsink and thermal paste before attempting overclocking
