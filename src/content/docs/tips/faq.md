  First fix to always check is to unplug and plug it back in (not just a restart in the UI).
  The most common cause then is that it overheated.  Make sure you are running at least v2.3 of the firmware and UI to see these warnings.  Go into the UI and check if the frequency and voltage need to be reset to defaults, then save and restart.
  If you are overclocking, you may need to increase the voltage as not enough voltage for the set frequency can cause it to underperform.
  Make sure the voltage is in the 4.8-5.2v range.
  Sometimes you have to redo the firmware update.

<summary>I want to overclock</summary>
  Overclocking is not recommended as you can damage components.  If you do overclock though, some things to keep in mind is that you want to keep the ASIC temperature under 70C and on gammas the VR under 90C.
  Your power adapter will likely need to be upgraded too.  You will know this if your voltage drops under 4.8v then your adapter cannot supply the necessary power for the overclock
