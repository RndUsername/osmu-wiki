title: About OSMU

Founded in March 2023, The Open Source Miners United are focused on Open Source Bitcoin mining.

Despite Bitcoin being _fundamentally_ open source since the beginning, Bitcoin mining has become tragically closed source and proprietary over the last decade. Being **decentralized** and **permissionless** are key traits of Bitcoin that allow it to be freedom money for the whole world... Open Source development is what ensures Bitcoin remains this way, forever.

Open Source Miners United are interested in the finer details of Bitcoin mining hardware, firmware and software. We reject industry gatekeeping and secrecy and strive to share what we have learned.
