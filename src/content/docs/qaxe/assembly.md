The assembly of the QAxe requires multiple tools. A broader overview can be found at [assembly](/tips/assembly).

# General

General can the QAxe be used with just 1 Asic chip. It's not needed to solder all of them, therefore it's recommended to work your way up to all four Asic chips. Make sure to cover the connection pins of the unsoldered Asic pads before applying a heatsink and testing the Asic's.
