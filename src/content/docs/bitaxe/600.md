## Software

1. Building your Software

   - You can build your own binary files from the source code. For more details follow this [Build-Guide](/axeos/compile).

2. Using a prebuild

   - Every Bitaxe is controlled by the open source available [ESP-Miner](https://github.com/skot/ESP-Miner) software. It features a WebUi for user friendly usage and controlablility.
   - In this repository you will also find a [releases](https://github.com/skot/ESP-Miner/releases) page that will contain prebuild binary files to flash to your Bitaxe using the [Bitaxetool](https://github.com/johnny9/bitaxetool) created by [johnny9](https://github.com/johnny9).

3. Flashing Process
   - The [ESP-Miner](https://github.com/skot/ESP-Miner) Software can be flashed via a USB cable onto the Bitaxe. Therefore you need to follow the initial Guide in the repository.
