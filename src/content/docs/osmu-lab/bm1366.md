## How to identify a cracked "destroyed" chip

![BM1366cracked](./BM1366cracked.png)

Here you can cleary see a crack right in the middle of the die. This indicates too much heat on the chip itself probably during a soldering attempt.
This crack identifies that this chip will no longer work and therefore has been destroyed.
It has multiple versions.
