While building an open-source miner like the [Bitaxe](/bitaxe/about) you come across closed-source parts and systems like the mining ASICs. In this section of the wiki, we want to publicize our findings and learnings from reverse engineering different things.

Furthermore will this section be used to publish any research paper of OSMU.
